# Expand selections in Sublime Text

These are two commands to help you work with Sublime Text. The first command is *select_left* and the second is *select_right*.

In Sublime Text, there are views, windows, cursors and selected regions. Each window has many views. In a view there may be several cursors. Every cursor has a selected region. Now we want to expand each selected region up until some text either before or after that region in the view.

When you run one of the two commands, it asks for a string. Then every single selected region in the current view will be expanded to the left or right respectively until the specified string. Now, your selected regions are bigger!
